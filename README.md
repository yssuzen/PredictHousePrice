Multilinear Regression Model for Predicting House Rent
This program uses a multilinear regression model to predict the rent of a house based on its area, number of rooms, and building age. It takes in a dataset of records containing information on the rent, area, number of rooms, and building age of various houses, and creates a regression model to predict the rent based on these features.

Installation
To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:
  1. pandas
  2. matplotlib
  3. scikit-learn
  
Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

  1. Download the multilinearregression.csv dataset and save it in the same directory as the program.
  2. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
  3. The program will import the dataset and create a multilinear regression model.
  4. The program will prompt you to enter the area, number of rooms, and building age of the house you want to predict the sale for.
  5. After entering the required features, the program will predict the sale of the house using the regression model and output the result.
  6. The program will also output the coefficients and intercept of the regression model.
